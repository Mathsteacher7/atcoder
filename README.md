Introduction
===========

This repository will contain translations of Atcoder archived contest editorials. Since most (all) of the editorials in ABC contests are in Japanese, this repo will contain translations of these editorials in order to enable competitive programmers to practice on these problems. The documentation will be hosted on readthedocs, and you are welcome to contribute more translations to the problem editorial translations.
